## Project Overview

The Fullerton College Instructional Building project demonstrated the critical importance of advanced VDC coordination and computational design in resolving complex construction challenges. This 76,494 SF, three-story Type II-B educational facility required sophisticated problem-solving approaches to overcome significant coordination failures and deliver innovative geometric solutions for a striking architectural dome feature.

**Project Specifications:**
- **Total Area:** 76,494 SF across three identical floors (25,498 SF each)
- **Building Height:** 75'-0" (maximum allowable per CBC Table 504.3)
- **Occupancy:** Primary Type B with Type A-3 accessory areas
- **Construction:** Type II-B, fully sprinklered educational facility

## Key Technologies Implemented

**Navisworks Federated Coordination Platform**
- Centralized coordination hub for 20-person multidisciplinary team
- Critical clash detection and resolution workflows
- Advanced model federation across all building systems
- Real-time coordination updates and conflict management

**Bluebeam Studio Collaborative Sessions**
- Live coordination sessions with integrated team reviews
- Real-time markup and issue tracking across disciplines
- Enhanced communication workflows for complex problem resolution
- Streamlined decision-making processes during critical coordination phases

**Grasshopper Parametric Scripting Platform**
- Advanced geometric problem-solving for complex dome tiling layout
- Computational design approach to 20,000 hexagonal tile coordination
- Automated center-point determination algorithms
- Custom scripting solutions for manufacturing constraint integration

## Critical Coordination Recovery

**Roof Truss Assembly Crisis Resolution**
The project faced a significant coordination failure when roof truss attachment to sill plates was not properly coordinated prior to IFC set release. As Model Manager, I led the comprehensive recovery effort:

- **Complete assembly redesign** coordinating roof trusses with supporting beam locations
- **Drainage slope maintenance** while resolving structural conflicts
- **Cross-disciplinary coordination** preventing cascading schedule impacts
- **Federated model management** ensuring all disciplines remained synchronized

This coordination recovery prevented substantial project delays and demonstrated the critical value of advanced VDC leadership during construction crises.

## Advanced Computational Design Solution

**20,000 Hexagonal Tile Dome Challenge**
The project's centerpiece featured a striking 9-foot radius decorative dome composed of 20,000 hexagonal tiles arranged in 5 unique color pattern leafs. The architectural team's initial flat layout presented critical fabrication challenges:

*Architectural design intent for the decorative hexagonal dome featuring complex 5-leaf color pattern arrangement*

**Problem:** Warped tile layouts incompatible with manufacturing die-cutting requirements
**Solution:** Custom Grasshopper parametric scripting approach

*Original architectural layout showing warped hexagonal tiles that could not be manufactured using standard die-cutting processes*

**Technical Innovation Process:**
- **Initial packing simulation** analysis for optimal tile distribution
- **Geometric center-point methodology** development for manufacturing compatibility
- **Leaf unrolling algorithms** translating 3D dome geometry to flat fabrication sheets
- **Uniform tile sizing calculations** meeting subcontractor die-cutting constraints

*Grasshopper-generated single leaf layout solution showing uniform hexagonal tile sizing and center-point distribution for manufacturing compatibility*

**Collaborative Design Integration**
Working directly with the architectural team in an IPD-style collaborative process, I provided revised tile layouts that balanced design intent with manufacturing reality:

- Maintained visual integrity of 5-leaf color patterns
- Ensured uniform tile dimensions for efficient fabrication
- Eliminated warped tile issues through computational geometry
- **Delivered 320+ hours of labor savings** (2 months for 2 workers)

## Project Leadership & Team Coordination

**Dual Technical Roles**
- **Model Manager:** Federated coordination for entire 76,494 SF facility
- **Metal Framing Detailer:** Complete building structural coordination
- **20-person coordination team** leadership across all disciplines
- **IPD-style collaboration** with architectural design team

**Advanced Problem-Solving Integration**
- Seamless coordination between crisis recovery and innovative design solutions
- Integration of computational design workflows with traditional BIM coordination
- Real-time collaboration between design intent and construction feasibility
- Advanced scripting solutions addressing complex geometric manufacturing constraints

## Innovation Impact & Technical Excellence

This project established new benchmarks for VDC crisis recovery and computational design integration. The successful resolution of critical coordination failures while simultaneously delivering advanced parametric design solutions demonstrated the essential value of sophisticated technical leadership in complex educational facility construction.

The Grasshopper scripting solution created reusable workflows for similar geometric challenges, while the coordination recovery methodologies became standard practice for managing complex assembly conflicts in federated environments.
