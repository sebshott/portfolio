## Project Overview

The Pacific Center Court project at 10399 Pacific Center Court, San Diego, CA established new industry benchmarks through pioneering technology implementation and sophisticated coordination methodologies. This comprehensive tenant improvement transformed a 58,513 SF office building into state-of-the-art office/laboratory space while introducing **company-wide Cupix Capture technology** for the first time.

**Project Specifications:**
- **Total Area:** 58,513 SF (43,150 SF first level, 15,363 SF second level)  
- **Scope:** Office-to-laboratory conversion with extensive MEP upgrades
- **Site:** 2.99-acre existing office building
- **Code Compliance:** 2019 California Building Codes, Type V-B construction

## Key Technologies Implemented

**Cupix Reality Capture Pioneer Deployment**
- First-ever company-wide implementation establishing new organizational standards
- Timeline-based documentation providing inspectors with comprehensive imagery
- In-wall installation tracking with photographic evidence for approval processes
- BIM integration enabling automated progress verification against coordinated models

**iConstruct BIMflows Automation Platform**
- Advanced model conditioning workflows across coordination phases
- Automated appearance management for multi-discipline coordination
- Streamlined deliverable production for 10-person detailing team
- Enhanced coordination efficiency through automated processes

## Critical Discovery & Problem Resolution

The Cupix reality capture technology revealed a **critical 2-foot longitudinal settling** of the building from end to endâ€”a structural condition that would have created substantial coordination conflicts and costly rework if discovered during construction phases.

**Immediate Problem-Solving Impact:**
- Established precise elevation benchmarks in each room
- Coordinated overhead MEP systems to prevent ceiling conflicts  
- Adjusted ceiling elevations to respective covering benchmarks
- **Prevented significant schedule delays and cost overruns** through early detection

## Team Leadership & Multi-Discipline Coordination

**Advanced Team Management**
- Led **10-person detailing team** across complex two-level coordination
- Managed intricate **MEP and Framing** discipline interactions
- Navigated challenging existing truss coordination requirements
- Developed detailed solutions around existing structural constraints

**Comprehensive MEP Systems Integration**
- HVAC ductwork and piping coordination throughout 58,513 SF
- New chill water system and pump integration at central plant yard
- Rooftop condensing unit installation coordination
- Electrical system complete demolition and replacement
- Laboratory-grade waste line systems for future tenant requirements

## Innovation Impact & Industry Advancement

**Technology Standards Establishment**
The successful Cupix implementation on Pacific Center Court established **new company-wide protocols** for construction documentation and quality control. The technology's ability to identify critical structural conditions demonstrated the essential value of reality capture in modern construction coordination.

**Organizational Transformation**
- Created foundation workflows for future Cupix deployments across all company projects
- Established integration standards between reality capture and traditional BIM coordination
- Developed quality control protocols preventing project-defining issues
- Advanced company-wide technological capabilities through successful pilot program

**Enhanced Coordination Methodologies**
- Seamless integration of automated workflows with complex coordination requirements
- Advanced model conditioning processes enabling efficient multi-discipline collaboration  
- Timeline-based documentation creating comprehensive project records
- Preventive quality control through early issue identification
