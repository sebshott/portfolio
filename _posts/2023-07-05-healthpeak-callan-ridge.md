## Project Overview

The Healthpeak Callan Ridge project at 3020 and 3030 Callan Road showcased advanced VDC coordination in a complex design-build environment. This three-story, 149,060 SF warm shell scientific research facility above two basement levels required extensive preconstruction coordination to integrate architectural vision with owner requirements while maintaining constructability.

## Project Scope & Complexity

**Facility Details:**
- 149,060 SF scientific research building across three stories
- Two basement levels for parking and mechanical systems
- Complete building envelope with house MEP systems
- Replacement of existing 91,000 SF R&D facility on 5-acre site
- Future lab space requiring specialized tenant improvement coordination

**Site Challenges:**
- Underground utility coordination across multiple systems
- Integration of prefabricated shade structures and green infrastructure
- Stormwater management compliance with SWQMP requirements
- Coordination between new construction and existing facility demolition

## VDC Technologies & Methodologies

**Navisworks & iConstruct Integration**
- Multi-trade coordination platform with real-time conflict detection
- Live model versioning control for continuous stakeholder alignment
- Integrated design-build workflow supporting owner/architectural input

**Stud Rail Penetration Coordination**
- Custom modeling of structural stud rails for precise penetration planning
- Proactive coordination between gravity piping systems and structure
- Field-ready penetration schedules preventing costly structural rework
- Systematic conflict avoidance for MEP/structural interfaces

**Underground Coordination Protocol**
- Systematic POC (point of connection) collection with invert elevations
- Collaborative utility routing verification with site utility engineers
- Comprehensive coordination extending beyond building footprint

**Roof Drainage System Redesign**
- Complete system reengineering through coordinated modeling
- Integration with building envelope and structural requirements
- Optimization for maintenance access and performance

## Results & Impact

- **15,000+ conflicts resolved** through systematic VDC coordination
- **Dozens of RFIs generated** to drive timely design solution closure
- **Seamless design-build integration** with enhanced owner collaboration
- **Comprehensive underground coordination** preventing costly field conflicts
- **Zero structural rework** from MEP penetration conflicts through stud rail modeling
- **Optimized penetration schedules** enabling efficient field execution
- **Roof drainage optimization** improving long-term building performance

## Design-Build Innovation Highlights

This project demonstrated the power of VDC in design-build delivery, where architectural vision, owner requirements, and constructability considerations must be balanced simultaneously. The innovative stud rail modeling approach exemplified proactive coordination, preventing the typical costly conflicts between gravity piping and structural elements that plague many projects.

The extensive preconstruction coordination effort created a robust foundation for construction execution while maintaining the collaborative spirit essential to successful design-build projects.
