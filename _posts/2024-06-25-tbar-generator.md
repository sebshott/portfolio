## Project Overview

Converting 2D DWG linework into accurate 3D T-bar ceiling systems was eating up hundreds of hours annually in supplemental modeling tasks. Our team needed a solution that could automatically generate precise T-bar layouts directly from architectural drawings.

## Results & Impact

- **200+ hours saved annually** in departmental efficiency gains
- **Consistent modeling standards** across all projects
- **Reduced human error** in ceiling system layouts
- **Enhanced clash detection and ceiling device coordination** through accurate 3D representations

*This automation has become a cornerstone of our VDC modeling process.*
