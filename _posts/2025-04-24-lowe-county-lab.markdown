*Onsite AR visualization using Magic Leap 2 headsets for real-time model overlay and installation verification*

**Dusty Robotic Layout System**
- Model-driven automated framing layouts
- Replaced traditional line-snapping methods
- Direct translation of coordinated BIM data to field execution

**Sitelink Augmented Reality Tools**
- On-site model overlay capabilities
- Real-time verification of installation locations
- Enhanced design intent communication

**Cupix Reality Capture & Analysis**
- Onsite installation tracking and progress monitoring
- Timeline-based photo data acquisition for comprehensive documentation
- BIM integration and installation QC through SLAMM algorithm
- Automated progress verification against coordinated models

## Results & Impact

- **30% reduction in layout time** through robotic automation
- **Enhanced coordination accuracy** across multiple building systems
- **Reduced material waste** through precise AR-guided installations
- **Improved stakeholder transparency** with real-time model access
- **Streamlined decision-making** reducing costly rework
- **Automated progress tracking** with timeline-based reality capture
- **Enhanced QC processes** through BIM-integrated progress verification

## Innovation Highlights

The project's success stemmed from seamless integration of digital coordination and field execution. The federated modeling approach in Revizto created unprecedented transparency, allowing Lowe County direct access to monitor development and validate both systems and design aesthetics in real-time.

The deployment of Dusty robotics marked a meaningful shift toward technology-enabled construction practices, while Sitelink's augmented reality capabilities strengthened the crucial connection between Steinberg Hart's design intent and field reality.

Cupix's reality capture technology provided continuous documentation and progress tracking, with its SLAMM algorithm enabling automated comparison between as-built conditions and BIM models for comprehensive quality control.

*This project establishes a strong precedent for innovation in the construction industry, demonstrating how integrated VDC workflows can drive collaboration, accuracy, and efficiency while delivering higher quality outcomes.*
