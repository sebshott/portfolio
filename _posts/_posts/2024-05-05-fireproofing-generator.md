## Project Overview

The Fireproofing Generator script revolutionizes how we approach fireproofing clearance modeling for structural components. Rather than manually remodeling beam families to include fireproofing thickness, this Dynamo automation creates precise 1" 3D clearance surfaces around any structural family type in minutes instead of hours.

## Technical Solution

**Dynamo-Powered Automation**
- Universal family type compatibility for structural components
- Automated offset surface generation with configurable clearance dimensions
- Mass-selection capability processing 500+ elements simultaneously
- One-minute execution time for comprehensive fireproofing clearance creation

**Current Deployment: 20-Story Commercial Building**
- Monokote/fireproofing generation across existing structural systems
- Beam and column component processing at building scale
- Integration with existing clash detection workflows
- Elimination of family remodeling requirements

## Process Innovation

**Traditional Method Replacement:**
- **Before:** Manual beam family modification to include fireproofing thickness
- **After:** Automated surface generation maintaining original family integrity
- **Workflow:** Mass-select → Execute script → Generate clearances → Clash detection ready

**Key Advantages:**
- Preserves original structural family data
- Enables rapid design iteration without remodeling
- Maintains model consistency across project phases
- Seamlessly integrates with coordination workflows

## Results & Impact

- **500+ elements processed** in under one minute
- **10 hours saved per 50,000 SF** of structural area
- **Eliminated family remodeling** requirements for fireproofing coordination
- **Enhanced clash detection accuracy** through precise clearance modeling
- **Scalable deployment** across multi-story commercial projects
